## Assignments

### Assignment 01: Socket Programming

- **Description**: This assignment involves socket programming in C/C++. It includes implementing a TCP server-client communication system and handling multiple clients. The assignment also covers creating a simple chat server and client, as well as a network calculator using both TCP and UDP protocols.

- **Objectives**:
  - **Concurrent Base64 Encoding Communication**: Implement a TCP-based communication protocol where the server decodes Base64 encoded messages from multiple clients and sends acknowledgments.
  - **Chat Server and Client**: Develop a chat application that supports multiple clients, allows message exchange, and ensures graceful exit.
  - **Network Calculator**: Create a TCP and UDP calculator where the client sends arithmetic expressions to the server, which evaluates and returns the results.

- **Files**:
   Contains the source code for all questions, including TCP and UDP implementations for calculator, chat server/client, and Base64 encoding/decoding.


**Instructions**:

### Assignment 02: Network Applications and Socket Programming

- **Description**: This assignment involves implementing various network applications using socket programming in C/C++/Java. The tasks include creating a DNS lookup tool, an HTTP web cache with LRU eviction policy, and a chat server with client-client communication capabilities.

- **Objectives**:
  - **Basic DNS Lookup**: Develop a DNS lookup tool that translates domain names into IP addresses using UDP sockets, without relying on external libraries.
  - **HTTP Web Cache**: Implement a web cache that stores recently accessed web pages and follows a least-recently-used (LRU) eviction policy. Use HTTP GET requests and socket programming for this task.
  - **Chat Server with Client-Client Communication**: Create a chat server that supports both broadcasting and private messaging between clients over TCP.

- **Files**:
   Contains the source code for all tasks, including implementations for DNS lookup, HTTP web cache, and chat server/client applications.

**Instructions**:

- After cloning the repository, navigate to the `assignment02` directory:
    ```bash
    cd assignment02
    ```

  - **Question 1: Basic DNS Lookup**
    1. **Compile the code**:
        ```bash
        gcc -o dnsLookup q1.c
        ```
    2. **Run the program**:
        ```bash
        ./dnsLookup
        ```
    3. **Follow the prompts** to input a domain name. The program will establish a UDP connection to the DNS server at 8.8.8.8, send a DNS query, and display the resolved IP address(es).


  - **Question 2: HTTP Web Cache**
    1. **Compile the code**:
        ```bash
        g++ -o q2 q2.cpp
        ```
    2. **Run the program**:
        ```bash
        ./q2
        ```
    3. **Follow the prompts** to enter a URL. The program will fetch the web page using HTTP GET requests, store it in the cache, and display the cache contents, which are managed using an LRU eviction policy.


  - **Question 3: Chat Server with Client-Client Communication**
    1. **Compile the server and client code**:
        ```bash
        g++ -std=c++11 -o client clientQ3.cpp
        g++ -std=c++11 -o server serverQ3.cpp
        ```
    2. **Run the server**:
        ```bash
        ./server <PORT>
        ```
    3. **Run the client**: Run the following in multiple terminal as different users.
        ```bash
        ./client <SERVER_IP> <PORT>
        ```
    4. **Chat:**

        - Type your message into the client terminal and press Enter to send a message.
        - Type `/exit` to exit the chat and close the client connection.
        - To broadcast a message to all clients, type `A` followed by your message.
        - To send a direct message to a specific client, type the client's socket number followed by your message.
    
    5. **Use the client** to connect to the server. You can send messages to all connected clients (broadcast) or to specific clients (private chat). Use `/exit` to terminate the client connection, and the server will notify all clients before shutting down.
